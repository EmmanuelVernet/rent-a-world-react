# Rent a World

"Rent a World" — an AirBnB-style booking app for fantasy universes. Built with Rails 8, Inertia.js with Ract, Tailwind, and live chat — everything from authentication to real-time messaging and notifications.

Why a fantasy world theme? Well, I wanted to theme the app with something more fun than flats. That's it!

# Roadmap (more in the GitHub issues tab)

## Features

## Running the app

# Gems

# Dowloading the repo

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Ruby 3.3.5
    *   Bundler
    *   Node.js and Yarn
    *   PostgreSQL

2.  **Setup:**
    *   Clone the repository.
    *   Run the setup script: `bin/setup`

3.  **Running the development server:**
    *   Run `bin/dev` and run migrations (bin/rails db:create db:migrate db:seed) to start the Rails server and the Tailwind CSS watcher.
    *   The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

4.  **Navigate the app and create a fake account (or use one from the seeds.rb file):**
    *   So that you can create bookings, worlds, chat with another user...
